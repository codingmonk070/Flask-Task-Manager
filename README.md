- **View Tasks**: All tasks can be viewed at once, with options to sort or filter based on criteria.
- **Update Tasks**: Users can edit the details of their tasks as needed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks that are no longer needed can be removed from the list.
- **Task Completion**: Tasks can be marked as completed.
